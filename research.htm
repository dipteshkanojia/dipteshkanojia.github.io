<td>Improvements in “Clue Marker Tool” and its Future Implications</td>
<td>Improved the context word searching scenario by providing the lexicographers with a rich corpus. Facilitated the clue addition to database by including Google Hindi Transliteration API within the
tool, and by including Concordancer Corpus search. Automated the clue searching by providing with an automatically generated possible clue set. Work on automatic clue addition in future using PMI and DICE indexing of the clues. 
Laid groundwork for a possible future rule based framework to be called, “Discrimination Net”.</td>

<td>Development of “Clue Marker Tool”</td>
<td>Emphasized on importance of context and clue words around a target word synset word. Developed “Sense Discrimination Tool” which facilitates the addition of clue words by
lexicographers manually into the WordNet database. Laid groundwork for automation of the tool in future using the clues present in the database, using various
heuristics.</td>

<td>Our work aimed at understanding the meaning and significance of “contextual evidence”, with
respect to the human sense disambiguation task. The experiments probed into the disambiguation time across different POS categories and ontological
categories, they also investigated into the set of clues in the neighbouring words of a pre-defined target
word.</td>
