abstract = {Automatic Cognate Detection helps NLP tasks of Machine Translation, Information Retrieval,
and Phylogenetics. Cognate words are defined as word pairs across languages which
exhibit partial or full lexical similarity and mean the same (e.g., hund-hound in
German-English). In this paper, we use a Siamese Feed-forward neural network with
word-embeddings to detect such word pairs. Our experiments with various embedding
dimensions show larger embedding dimensions can only be used for large corpora sizes
for this task. On a dataset built using linked Indian Wordnets, our approach beats
the baseline approach with a significant margin (up to 71%) with the best F-score
of 0.85% on the Hindi-Gujarati language pair.},
