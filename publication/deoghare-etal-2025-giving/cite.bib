    abstract = "Automatic Post-Editing (APE) systems often struggle with over-correction, where unnecessary modifications are made to a translation, diverging from the principle of minimal editing. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to mitigate over-correction by incorporating word-level Quality Estimation (QE) information during the decoding process. This method is architecture-agnostic, making it adaptable to any APE system, regardless of the underlying model or training approach. Our experiments on English-German, English-Hindi, and English-Marathi language pairs show the proposed approach yields significant improvements over their corresponding baseline APE systems, with TER gains of 0.65, 1.86, and 1.44 points, respectively. These results underscore the complementary relationship between QE and APE tasks and highlight the effectiveness of integrating QE information to reduce over-correction in APE systems."
