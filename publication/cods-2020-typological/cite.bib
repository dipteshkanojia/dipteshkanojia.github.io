abstract = {Establishing language relatedness by inferring phylogenetic trees has been a topic
of interest in the area of diachronic linguistics. However, existing methods face
meaning conflation deficiency due to the usage of lexical similarity-based measures.
In this paper, we utilize fourteen linked Indian Wordnets to create inter-language
distances using our novel approach to compute 'language distances'. Our pilot study
uses deep cross-lingual word embeddings to compute inter-language distances and provide
an effective distance matrix to infer phylogenetic trees. We also develop a baseline
method using lexical similarity-based metrics for comparison and identify that our
approach produces better phylogenetic trees which club related languages closer when
compared to the baseline approach.},
