This problem is called Noun Compound Interpretation (NCI). We use FrameNet as a semantic label repository. For example, given the noun compound (board approval), we predict the frame (DENY OR GRANT PERMISSION, as per FrameNet) as appropriate and the semantic role of the modifier word (AUTHORITY) as the semantic label linking board and approval; the resulting label is DENY OR GRANT PERMISSION:AUTHORITY. Our semantic label repository is very large (≈11k labels) compared to the NC data available for training (approx 1900). Thus, learning in this case, especially for unseen semantic labels, is hard. We propose to solve this problem by predicting semantic labels in a continuous label embedding space, which is novel. This embedding space is created by learning label embeddings using the FrameNet data. The embeddings are then used to train two separate models – one for predicting Frames and the other for FEs. As the label embedding space captures the semantics of the labels, using these embeddings enables generalizing well on unseen labels, thus achieving zero-shot learning. Our preliminary investigations show that the proposed approach performs well for unseen labels, achieving 5% and 2% points improvements over baselines for the frame and FE prediction, respectively. The study shows the promise of the use of continuous space embeddings for noun compound interpretation and points to the need for further investigation.","tags":["noun-compound","deep learning","framenet","theoretical"],"title":"FrameNet-assisted Noun Compound Interpretation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diptesh Kanojia","Prashant Sharma","Sayali Ghodekar","Pushpak Bhattacharyya","Gholamreza Haffari","Malhar Kulkarni"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1619136000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619136000,"objectID":"9975875309a41d4a552b44995a750bfe","permalink":"/publication/eacl-2021-cognate/","publishdate":"2021-04-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/eacl-2021-cognate/","section":"publication","summary":"Automatic detection of cognates helps downstream NLP tasks of Machine Translation, Cross-lingual Information Retrieval, Computational Phylogenetics and Cross-lingual Named Entity Recognition.

We, then, evaluate the impact of our cognate detection mechanism on neural machine translation (NMT), as a downstream task. We evaluate our methods to detect cognates on a challenging dataset of twelve Indian languages, namely, Sanskrit, Hindi, Assamese, Oriya, Kannada, Gujarati, Tamil, Telugu, Punjabi, Bengali, Marathi, and Malayalam. Additionally, we create evaluation datasets for two more Indian languages, Konkani and Nepali. We observe an improvement of up to 18% points, in terms of F-score, for cognate detection.

Several software, have been developed and are available in the field of computational linguistics. Such tools play a crucial role in making classical language texts easily accessible. Some Indian philosophical schools have contributed towards various techniques of verbal cognition to analyze sentence correctly. These theories can be used to build computational tools for word sense disambiguation (WSD). In the absence of WSD, one cannot have proper verbal cognition. These theories considered the concept of ‘Yogyatā’ (congruity or compatibility) as the indispensable cause of verbal cognition. In this work, we come up with some insights on the basis of these theories to create a tool that will capture Yogyatā of words. We describe the problem of ambiguity in a text and present a method to resolve it computationally with the help of Yogyatā. Here, only two major schools i.e. Nyāya and Vyākaraṇa are considered. Our paper attempts to show the implication of the creation of our tool in this area. Also, our tool involves the creation of an ‘ontological tag-set’ as well as strategies to mark up the lexicon. The introductory description of ablation is also covered in this paper. Such strategies and some case studies shall form the core of our paper.","tags":["word sense disambiguation","sanskrit","linguistics"],"title":"Some Strategies to Capture Karaka-Yogyata with Special Reference to apadana","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diptesh Kanojia"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1544878800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544878800,"objectID":"c46e5d205d31b278be6c8ed9867f9473","permalink":"/talk/techfestalk/","publishdate":"2018-12-15T13:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/techfestalk/","section":"talk","summary":"In this talk, I discuss Natural Language Processing, Data Science and how they are related to each other. While presenting the different facets of the NLP research done at our lab, I connected it to how a data scientist can use the research to solve a relatable real-world issue. I discussed the NLP research areas of Machine Translation, Sentiment Analysis, Sarcasm Detection, Speech Processing, Cognitive NLP and then went into details of Computational Phylogenetics and Cognate Detection, the latter two being a part of my Ph.D. Thesis. I also presented some excerpts of his work from a recent publication at CODS-COMAD 2019 and explained how Cognate detection is an important problem in the area of Historical and Cultural Linguistics. The talk was well received as the feedback from the students and some entrepreneurs were positive. Later, it transcended more into an interactive session on what tools can an amateur use to start NLP and what online courses can one pursue to deal with these NLP problems.","tags":["talks"],"title":"Natural Language Processing and its intersection with Data Science","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Sandeep Mathias","Diptesh Kanojia","Kevin Patel","Samarth Agarwal","Abhijit Mishra","Pushpak Bhattacharyya"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"b0de83230d96792faac13f9cd22589dc","permalink":"/publication/mathias-2018-eyes/","publishdate":"2019-06-27T12:40:43.658566Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mathias-2018-eyes/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["essay grading","gaze tracking"],"title":"Eyes are the Windows to the Soul: Predicting the Rating of Text Quality Using Gaze Behaviour","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hanumant Redkar","Rajita Shukla","Sandhya Singh","Jaya Saraswati","Laxmi Kashyap","Diptesh Kanojia","Preethi Jyothi","Malhar Kulkarni","Pushpak Bhattacharyya"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"6c2143e1be7cf1a37b9ff8d925206eb7","permalink":"/publication/redkar-2018-hindi/","publishdate":"2019-06-27T12:40:43.636641Z","relpermalink":"/publication/redkar-2018-hindi/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["teaching","hindi","wordnets","linguistics"],"title":"Hindi Wordnet for Language Teaching: Experiences and Lessons Learnt","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diptesh Kanojia","Kevin Patel","Pushpak Bhattacharyya"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"9224743bc44e4b49ccb53dfd30ef6bc7","permalink":"/publication/kanojia-2018-indian/","publishdate":"2019-06-27T12:40:43.637105Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kanojia-2018-indian/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["api","wordnets","mapping"],"title":"Indian Language Wordnets and their Linkages with Princeton WordNet","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jayashree Gajjam","Diptesh Kanojia","Malhar Kulkarni"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"c234725d46b01454d96696ff671e0c0f","permalink":"/publication/gajjam-2018-new/","publishdate":"2019-06-27T12:40:43.658152Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gajjam-2018-new/","section":"publication","summary":"A sentence is an important notion in the Indian grammatical tradition. The collection of the definitions of a sentence can be found in the text ‘Vākyapadīya’ written by Bhartṛhari in fifth century C.E. The grammarian-philosopher Bhartṛhari and his authoritative work ‘Vākyapadīya’ have been a matter of study for modern scholars, at least for more than 50 years, since Ashok Aklujkar submitted his Ph.D. dissertation at Harvard University. The notions of a sentence and a word as a meaningful linguistic unit in the language have been a subject matter for the discussion in many works that followed later on. While some scholars have applied philological techniques to critically establish the text of the works of Bhartṛhari, some others have devoted themselves to exploring philosophical insights from them. Some others have studied his works from the point of view of modern linguistics, and psychology. Few others have tried to justify the views by logical discussions. In this paper, we present a fresh view to study Bhartṛhari, and his works, especially the ‘Vākyapadīya’. This view is from the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), more specifically, what is called as Cognitive NLP. We have studied the definitions of a sentence given by Bhartṛhari at the beginning of the second chapter of ‘Vākyapadīya’. We have researched one of these definitions by conducting an experiment and following the methodology of silent-reading of Sanskrit paragraphs. We collect the Gaze-behavior data of participants and analyze it to understand the underlying comprehension procedure in the human mind and present our results. We evaluate the statistical significance of our results using T-test, and discuss the caveats of our work. We also present some general remarks on this experiment and usefulness of this method for gaining more insights in the work of Bhartṛhari.","tags":["gaze tracking","sanskrit","linguistics"],"title":"New Vistas to study Bhartṛhari: Cognitive NLP","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ritesh Panjwani","Diptesh Kanojia","Pushpak Bhattacharyya"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"4a96343e39d82e05e1e94b8c95451501","permalink":"/publication/panjwani-2018-pyiwn/","publishdate":"2019-06-27T12:40:43.636412Z","relpermalink":"/publication/panjwani-2018-pyiwn/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["api","wordnets","application"],"title":"pyiwn: A Python-based API to access Indian Language WordNets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kevin Patel","Diptesh Kanojia","Pushpak Bhattacharyya"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"e549b5253c882cd4600363d7eed5ab7a","permalink":"/publication/patel-2018-semi/","publishdate":"2019-06-27T12:40:43.636185Z","relpermalink":"/publication/patel-2018-semi/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["mapping","wordnets","linguistics"],"title":"Semi-automatic WordNet Linking using Word Embeddings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diptesh Kanojia","Preethi Jyothi","Pushpak Bhattacharyya"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"956d431caad5bf8b1c040719082e4143","permalink":"/publication/kanojia-2018-synthesizing/","publishdate":"2019-06-27T12:40:43.635953Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kanojia-2018-synthesizing/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["speech synthesis","wordnets","linguistics"],"title":"Synthesizing Audio for Hindi Wordnet","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diptesh Kanojia","Nikhil Wani","Pushpak Bhattacharyya"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"1d266404a0de73edef83e42e47f05123","permalink":"/publication/kanojia-2017-your/","publishdate":"2019-06-27T12:40:43.636877Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kanojia-2017-your/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["application","sop","prediction"],"title":"Is your Statement Purposeless?

Our results show that the existing Cartesian product approach which is used to create the pseudo-parallel data results in a degradation on tourism and health datasets, for English-Hindi MT. Our paper points to the fact that existing Cartesian approach using multilingual topics (devised for European languages) may be detrimental for Indian language MT. On the other hand, we present an alternate ‘sentential’ approach that leads to a slight improvement.

These mined collection of contextual clues form a discrimination net in the sense that for targeted WSD, navigation of the net leads to the correct sense of a word given its context. Utilizing this resource we intend to develop efficient and light weight WSD based on look up and navigation of memory-resident knowledge base, thereby avoiding heavy computation which often prevents incorporation of any serious WSD in MT and search. The need for large quantities of sense marked data too can be reduced.","tags":["wordnets","word sense disambiguation","theoretical"],"title":"Do not do processing, when you can look up: Towards a Discrimination Net for WSD","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diptesh Kanojia","Manish Shrivastava","Raj Dabre","Pushpak Bhattacharyya"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"a5bb7954e38e4049139a6644ccfab71d","permalink":"/publication/kanojia-2014-pacman/","publishdate":"2019-06-27T12:40:43.63225Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kanojia-2014-pacman/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a Parallel Corpora Management tool that aides parallel corpora generation for the task of Machine Translation (MT). It takes source and target text of a corpus for any language pair in text file format, or zip archives containing multiple corresponding text files. Then, it provides with a helpful interface to lexicographers for manual translation / validation, and gives out the corrected text files as output. It provides various dictionary references as help within the interface which increase the productivity and efficiency of a lexicographer. It also provides automatic translation of the source sentence using an integrated MT system. The tool interface includes a corpora management system which facilitates maintenance of parallel corpora by assigning roles such as manager, lexicographer etc. We have designed a novel tool that provides aides like references to various dictionary sources such as Wordnets, Shabdkosh, Wikitionary etc. We also provide manual word alignment correction which is visualized in the tool and can lead to its gamification in the future, thus, providing a valuable source of word / phrase alignments.","tags":["machine translation","corpus management","application"],"title":"PaCMan: Parallel Corpus Management Workbench","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Neha R Prabhugaonkar","JD Pawar","Apurva S Nagvenkar","Pushpak Bhattacharyya","Diptesh Kanojia","Manish Shrivastava"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"14afd32d7d582d2abf7b2f5a21261a3c","permalink":"/publication/prabhugaonkar-2014-panchbhoota/","publishdate":"2019-06-27T12:40:43.632478Z","relpermalink":"/publication/prabhugaonkar-2014-panchbhoota/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["machine translation","linguistics"],"title":"PanchBhoota: Hierarchical phrase based machine translation systems for five Indian languages","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Salil Joshi","Diptesh Kanojia","Pushpak Bhattacharyya"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"d666c7337ff369f3e55a383f15eeedda","permalink":"/publication/joshi-2013-more/","publishdate":"2019-06-27T12:40:43.631473Z","relpermalink":"/publication/joshi-2013-more/","section":"publication","summary":"Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) approaches have reported good accuracies in recent years. However, these approaches can be classified as weak AI systems. According to the classical definition, a strong AI based WSD system should perform the task of sense disambiguation in the same manner and with similar accuracy as human beings. In order to accomplish this, a detailed understanding of the human techniques employed for sense disambiguation is necessary. Instead of building yet another WSD system that uses contextual evidence for sense disambiguation, as has been done before, we have taken a step back - we have endeavored to discover the cognitive faculties that lie at the very core of the human sense disambiguation technique. In this paper, we present a hypothesis regarding the cognitive sub-processes involved in the task of WSD. We support our hypothesis using the experiments conducted through the means of an eye-tracking device. We also strive to find the levels of difficulties in annotating various classes of words, with senses. We believe, once such an in-depth analysis is performed, numerous insights can be gained to develop a robust WSD system that conforms to the principle of strong AI.","tags":["gaze tracking","word sense disambiguation","theoretical"],"title":"More than meets the eye: Study of Human Cognition in Sense Annotation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Arindam Chatterjee","Salil Joshi","Pushpak Bhattacharyya","Diptesh Kanojia","Akhlesh Kumar Meena"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"cb5f13494aed36490a8f152e07b74d5d","permalink":"/publication/chatterjee-2012-study/","publishdate":"2019-06-27T12:40:43.631013Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chatterjee-2012-study/","section":"publication","summary":"Does context help determine sense? This question might seem frivolous, even preposterous to anybody sensible. However, our long time research on Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) shows that in almost all disambiguation algorithms, the sense distribution parameter P(S/W), where P is the probability of the sense of a word W being S, plays the deciding role. The widely reported accuracy figure of around 60% for all-words-domain-independent WSD is contributed to mainly by P(S/W), as one ablation test after another reveals. The story with human annotation is different though. Our experience of working with human annotators who mark with WordNet sense ids, general and domain specific corpora brings to light the interesting fact that producing sense ids without looking at the context is a heavy cognitive load. Sense annotators do form hypothesis in their minds about the possible sense of a word (‘most frequent sense’ bias), but then look at the context for clues to accept or reject the hypothesis. Such clues are minimal, just one or two words, but are critical nonetheless. Without these clues the annotator is left in an indecisive state as to whether or not to put down the first sense coming to his mind. The task becomes all the more cognitively challenging, if the senses are fine grained and seem equally probable. These facts increase the annotation time by a factor of almost 1.5. In the current paper we explore the dichotomy that might exist between machines and humans in the way they determine senses. We study the various parameters for WSD and also the sense marking behavior of human sense annotators. The observations, though not completely conclusive, establish the need for context for humans and that for accurate sense distribution parameters for machines.","tags":["word sense disambiguation","theoretical"],"title":"A Study of the Sense Annotation Process: Man v/s Machine.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diptesh Kanojia","Arindam Chatterjee","Salil Joshi","Pushpak Bhattacharyya"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"90073a90cba2d3992fee7ae2988160f3","permalink":"/publication/kanojia-2012-discrimination/","publishdate":"2019-06-27T12:40:43.632706Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kanojia-2012-discrimination/","section":"publication","summary":"Current state-of-the-art Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) algorithms are mostly supervised and use the P (Sense|Word) statistic for annotation. This P (Sense|Word) statistic is obtained after training the model on an annotated corpus. The performance of WSD algorithms do not match the efficiency and quality of human annotation. It is therefore important to know the role of the contextual clues in WSD. Human beings in turn, actuate the task of disambiguating the sense of a word, by gathering hints from the context words in the neighbourhood of the word. Contextual clues thus form the basic building block for the human sense disambiguation task. The need was thus felt for a tool, which could help us get a deeper insight into the human mind, while disambiguating polysemous words. As mentioned earlier, in the human mind, sense disambiguation highly depends on finding clues in corpus text, which finally lead to a winner sense. In order to make WSD algorithms more efficient, it is highly desirable to assimilate knowledge regarding contextual clues of words. In order to make WSD algorithms more efficient, it is highly desirable to assimilate knowledge regarding contextual clues of words, which aid in finding correct senses of words in that context. Hence, we developed a tool which could help a lexicographer mark the clues for disambiguating a word in a context. In the current phase, this tool lets the lexicographer select the clues from the gloss and example fields in the synset, and adds them to a database.","tags":["word sense disambiguation","applciation","linguistics"],"title":"Discrimination-net for Hindi","type":"publication"}]
