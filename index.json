Unidentified cognate pairs can pose a challenge to these applications and result in a degradation of performance. In this paper, we detect cognate word pairs among ten Indian languages with Hindi and use deep learning methodologies to predict whether a word pair is cognate or not. We identify IndoWordnet as a potential resource to detect cognate word pairs based on orthographic similarity-based methods and train neural network models using the data obtained from it. We identify parallel corpora as another potential resource and perform the same experiments for them. We also validate the contribution of Wordnets through further experimentation and report improved performance of up to 26%. We discuss the nuances of cognate detection among closely related Indian languages and release the lists of detected cognates as a dataset. We also observe the behaviour of, to an extent, unrelated Indian language pairs and release the lists of detected cognates among them as well.","tags":["cognate detection","phylogenetics","wordnets","theoretical"],"title":"Utilizing Wordnets for Cognate Detection among Indian Languages","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diptesh Kanojia","Malhar Kulkarni","Pushpak Bhattacharyya","Gholemreza Haffari"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"61c3322c291fdf21d26a7391097536ee","permalink":"/publication/kanojia-2019-cognate/","publishdate":"2019-06-27T12:40:43.659033Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kanojia-2019-cognate/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["cognate detection","wordnets","linguistics"],"title":"Cognate Identification to improve Phylogenetic trees for Indian Languages","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Swaraja Salaskar","Diptesh Kanojia","Malhar Kulkarni"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"c8545d3558190c1f5e7c488362e5cbf7","permalink":"/publication/salaskar-2019-some/","publishdate":"2019-06-27T12:40:43.659403Z","relpermalink":"/publication/salaskar-2019-some/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["word sense disambiguation","sanskrit","linguistics"],"title":"Some Strategies to Capture Karaka-Yogyata with Special Reference to apadana","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diptesh Kanojia"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1544812200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544812200,"objectID":"c46e5d205d31b278be6c8ed9867f9473","permalink":"/talk/techfestalk/","publishdate":"2018-12-15T00:00:00+05:30","relpermalink":"/talk/techfestalk/","section":"talk","summary":"In this talk, I discuss Natural Language Processing, Data Science and how they are related to each other. While presenting the different facets of the NLP research done at our lab, I connected it to how a data scientist can use the research to solve a relatable real-world issue. I discussed the NLP research areas of Machine Translation, Sentiment Analysis, Sarcasm Detection, Speech Processing, Cognitive NLP and then went into details of Computational Phylogenetics and Cognate Detection, the latter two being a part of my Ph.D. Thesis. I also presented some excerpts of his work from a recent publication at CODS-COMAD 2019 and explained how Cognate detection is an important problem in the area of Historical and Cultural Linguistics. The talk was well received as the feedback from the students and some entrepreneurs were positive. Later, it transcended more into an interactive session on what tools can an amateur use to start NLP and what online courses can one pursue to deal with these NLP problems.","tags":["talks"],"title":"Natural Language Processing and its intersection with Data Science","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Sandeep Mathias","Diptesh Kanojia","Kevin Patel","Samarth Agarwal","Abhijit Mishra","Pushpak Bhattacharyya"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"b0de83230d96792faac13f9cd22589dc","permalink":"/publication/mathias-2018-eyes/","publishdate":"2019-06-27T12:40:43.658566Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mathias-2018-eyes/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["essay grading","gaze tracking"],"title":"Eyes are the Windows to the Soul: Predicting the Rating of Text Quality Using Gaze Behaviour","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hanumant Redkar","Rajita Shukla","Sandhya Singh","Jaya Saraswati","Laxmi Kashyap","Diptesh Kanojia","Preethi Jyothi","Malhar Kulkarni","Pushpak Bhattacharyya"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"6c2143e1be7cf1a37b9ff8d925206eb7","permalink":"/publication/redkar-2018-hindi/","publishdate":"2019-06-27T12:40:43.636641Z","relpermalink":"/publication/redkar-2018-hindi/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["teaching","hindi","wordnets","linguistics"],"title":"Hindi Wordnet for Language Teaching: Experiences and Lessons Learnt","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diptesh Kanojia","Kevin Patel","Pushpak Bhattacharyya"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"9224743bc44e4b49ccb53dfd30ef6bc7","permalink":"/publication/kanojia-2018-indian/","publishdate":"2019-06-27T12:40:43.637105Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kanojia-2018-indian/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["api","wordnets","mapping"],"title":"Indian Language Wordnets and their Linkages with Princeton WordNet","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jayashree Gajjam","Diptesh Kanojia","Malhar Kulkarni"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"c234725d46b01454d96696ff671e0c0f","permalink":"/publication/gajjam-2018-new/","publishdate":"2019-06-27T12:40:43.658152Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gajjam-2018-new/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["gaze tracking","sanskrit","linguistics"],"title":"New Vistas to study Bhartá¹›hari: Cognitive NLP","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kevin Patel","Diptesh Kanojia","Pushpak Bhattacharyya"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"e549b5253c882cd4600363d7eed5ab7a","permalink":"/publication/patel-2018-semi/","publishdate":"2019-06-27T12:40:43.636185Z","relpermalink":"/publication/patel-2018-semi/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["mapping","wordnets","linguistics"],"title":"Semi-automatic WordNet Linking using Word Embeddings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diptesh Kanojia","Preethi Jyothi","Pushpak Bhattacharyya"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"956d431caad5bf8b1c040719082e4143","permalink":"/publication/kanojia-2018-synthesizing/","publishdate":"2019-06-27T12:40:43.635953Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kanojia-2018-synthesizing/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["speech synthesis","wordnets","linguistics"],"title":"Synthesizing Audio for Hindi Wordnet","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ritesh Panjwani","Diptesh Kanojia","Pushpak Bhattacharyya"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"4a96343e39d82e05e1e94b8c95451501","permalink":"/publication/panjwani-2018-pyiwn/","publishdate":"2019-06-27T12:40:43.636412Z","relpermalink":"/publication/panjwani-2018-pyiwn/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["api","wordnets","application"],"title":"pyiwn: A Python-based API to access Indian Language WordNets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diptesh Kanojia","Nikhil Wani","Pushpak Bhattacharyya"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"1d266404a0de73edef83e42e47f05123","permalink":"/publication/kanojia-2017-your/","publishdate":"2019-06-27T12:40:43.636877Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kanojia-2017-your/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["application","sop","prediction"],"title":"Is your Statement Purposeless?
