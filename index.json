They pose a challenge to various Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications such as Machine Translation, Cross-lingual Sense Disambiguation, Computational Phylogenetics, and Information Retrieval. A possible solution to address this challenge is to identify cognates across language pairs. In this paper, we describe the creation of two cognate datasets for twelve Indian languages, namely Sanskrit, Hindi, Assamese, Oriya, Kannada, Gujarati, Tamil, Telugu, Punjabi, Bengali, Marathi, and Malayalam. We digitize the cognate data from an Indian language cognate dictionary and utilize linked Indian language Wordnets to generate cognate sets. Additionally, we use the Wordnet data to create a False Friends' dataset for eleven language pairs. We also evaluate the efficacy of our dataset using previously available baseline cognate detection approaches. We also perform a manual evaluation with the help of lexicographers and release the curated gold-standard dataset with this paper.","tags":["cognate detection","false friends detection","cognate

Cognate Detection (ACD) is a challenging task which has been utilized to help NLP applications like Machine Translation, Information Retrieval and Computational Phylogenetics. Unidentified cognate pairs can pose a challenge to these applications and result in a degradation of performance. In this paper, we detect cognate word pairs among ten Indian languages with Hindi and use deep learning methodologies to predict whether a word pair is cognate or not. We identify IndoWordnet as a potential resource to detect cognate word pairs based on orthographic similarity-based methods and train neural network models using the data obtained from it. We identify parallel corpora as another potential resource and perform the same experiments for them. We also validate the contribution of Wordnets through further experimentation and report improved performance of up to 26%. We discuss the nuances of cognate detection among closely related Indian languages and release the lists of detected cognates as a dataset. We also observe the behaviour of, to an extent, unrelated Indian language pairs and release the lists of detected cognates among them as well.","tags":["cognate detection","phylogenetics","wordnets","theoretical"],"title":"Utilizing Wordnets for Cognate Detection among Indian Languages","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diptesh Kanojia","Malhar Kulkarni","Pushpak Bhattacharyya","Gholemreza Haffari"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"61c3322c291fdf21d26a7391097536ee","permalink":"/publication/kanojia-2019-cognate/","publishdate":"2019-06-27T12:40:43.659033Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kanojia-2019-cognate/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["cognate detection","wordnets","linguistics"],"title":"Cognate Identification to improve Phylogenetic trees for Indian Languages","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Swaraja Salaskar","Diptesh Kanojia","Malhar Kulkarni"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"c8545d3558190c1f5e7c488362e5cbf7","permalink":"/publication/salaskar-2019-some/","publishdate":"2019-06-27T12:40:43.659403Z","relpermalink":"/publication/salaskar-2019-some/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["word sense disambiguation","sanskrit","linguistics"],"title":"Some Strategies to Capture Karaka-Yogyata with Special Reference to apadana","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diptesh Kanojia"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1544878800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544878800,"objectID":"c46e5d205d31b278be6c8ed9867f9473","permalink":"/talk/techfestalk/","publishdate":"2018-12-15T13:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/techfestalk/","section":"talk","summary":"In this talk, I discuss Natural Language Processing, Data Science and how they are related to each other.
