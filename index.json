Unidentified cognate pairs can pose a challenge to these applications and result in a degradation of performance. In this paper, we detect cognate word pairs among ten Indian languages with Hindi and use deep learning methodologies to predict whether a word pair is cognate or not. We identify IndoWordnet as a potential resource to detect cognate word pairs based on orthographic similarity-based methods and train neural network models using the data obtained from it. We identify parallel corpora as another potential resource and perform the same experiments for them. We also validate the contribution of Wordnets through further experimentation and report improved performance of up to 26%. We discuss the nuances of cognate detection among closely related Indian languages and release the lists of detected cognates as a dataset. We also observe the behaviour of, to an extent, unrelated Indian language pairs and release the lists of detected cognates among them as well.","tags":[],"title":"Utilizing Wordnets for Cognate Detection among Indian Languages","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diptesh Kanojia","Malhar Kulkarni","Pushpak Bhattacharyya","Gholemreza Haffari"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"61c3322c291fdf21d26a7391097536ee","permalink":"https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/publication/kanojia-2019-cognate/","publishdate":"2019-06-27T12:40:43.659033Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kanojia-2019-cognate/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Cognate Identification to improve Phylogenetic trees for Indian Languages","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Swaraja Salaskar","Diptesh Kanojia","Malhar Kulkarni"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"c8545d3558190c1f5e7c488362e5cbf7","permalink":"https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/publication/salaskar-2019-some/","publishdate":"2019-06-27T12:40:43.659403Z","relpermalink":"/publication/salaskar-2019-some/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Some Strategies to Capture Karaka-Yogyata with Special Reference to apadana","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diptesh Kanojia"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546281000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546281000,"objectID":"84d17c1c55af735d59da07b46f39b679","permalink":"https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/talk/vivatalk/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00+05:30","relpermalink":"/talk/vivatalk/","section":"talk","summary":"In three different talks, I discussed various facets of fundamental NLP research being done at CFILT, IIT Bombay.

I discussed the NLP research areas of Machine Translation, Sentiment Analysis, Sarcasm Detection, Speech Processing, Cognitive NLP and then went into details of Computational Phylogenetics and Cognate Detection, the latter two being a part of my Ph.D. Thesis. I also presented some excerpts of his work from a recent publication at CODS-COMAD 2019 and explained how Cognate detection is an important problem in the area of Historical and Cultural Linguistics. The talk was well received as the feedback from the students and some entrepreneurs were positive. Later, it transcended more into an interactive session on what tools can an amateur use to start NLP and what online courses can one pursue to deal with these NLP problems.","tags":["internal-project"],"title":"Natural Language Processing and its intersection with Data Science","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;\n","date":1536431400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536431400,"objectID":"6a451186c775f5f0adb3a0416d0cb711","permalink":"https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/tutorial/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00+05:30","relpermalink":"/tutorial/example/","section":"tutorial","summary":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Example Page","type":"docs"},{"authors":["Sandeep Mathias","Diptesh Kanojia","Kevin Patel","Samarth Agarwal","Abhijit Mishra","Pushpak Bhattacharyya"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1528741800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1528741800,"objectID":"70a9e862cdd63ccbdf0e51b52ff43bb2","permalink":"https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/publication/acl-2018-sandeep/","publishdate":"2018-06-12T00:00:00+05:30","relpermalink":"/publication/acl-2018-sandeep/","section":"publication","summary":"Predicting a readerâ€™s rating of text quality is a challenging task that involves estimating different subjective aspects of the text, like structure, clarity, etc. Such subjective aspects are better handled using cognitive information. One such source of cognitive information is gaze behaviour. In this paper, we show that gaze behaviour does indeed help in effectively predicting the rating of text quality. To do this, we first model text quality as a function of three properties - organization, coherence and cohesion. Then, we demonstrate how capturing gaze behaviour helps in predicting each of these properties, and hence the overall quality, by reporting improvements obtained by adding gaze features to traditional textual features for score prediction. We also hypothesize that if a reader has fully understood the text, the corresponding gaze behaviour would give a better indication of the assigned rating, as opposed to partial understanding. Our experiments validate this hypothesis by showing greater agreement between the given rating and the predicted rating when the reader has a full understanding of the text.","tags":[],"title":"Eyes are the Windows to the Soul: Predicting the Rating of Text Quality Using Gaze Behaviour","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sandeep Mathias","Diptesh Kanojia","Kevin Patel","Samarth Agarwal","Abhijit Mishra","Pushpak Bhattacharyya"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"b0de83230d96792faac13f9cd22589dc","permalink":"https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/publication/mathias-2018-eyes/","publishdate":"2019-06-27T12:40:43.658566Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mathias-2018-eyes/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Eyes are the Windows to the Soul: Predicting the Rating of Text Quality Using Gaze Behaviour","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hanumant Redkar","Rajita Shukla","Sandhya Singh","Jaya Saraswati","Laxmi Kashyap","Diptesh Kanojia","Preethi Jyothi","Malhar Kulkarni","Pushpak Bhattacharyya"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"6c2143e1be7cf1a37b9ff8d925206eb7","permalink":"https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/publication/redkar-2018-hindi/","publishdate":"2019-06-27T12:40:43.636641Z","relpermalink":"/publication/redkar-2018-hindi/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Hindi Wordnet for Language Teaching: Experiences and Lessons Learnt","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diptesh Kanojia","Kevin Patel","Pushpak Bhattacharyya"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"9224743bc44e4b49ccb53dfd30ef6bc7","permalink":"https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/publication/kanojia-2018-indian/","publishdate":"2019-06-27T12:40:43.637105Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kanojia-2018-indian/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Indian Language Wordnets and their Linkages with Princeton WordNet","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jayashree Gajjam","Diptesh Kanojia","Malhar Kulkarni"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"c234725d46b01454d96696ff671e0c0f","permalink":"https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/publication/gajjam-2018-new/","publishdate":"2019-06-27T12:40:43.658152Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gajjam-2018-new/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"New Vistas to study Bhartá¹›hari: Cognitive NLP","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kevin Patel","Diptesh Kanojia","Pushpak Bhattacharyya"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"e549b5253c882cd4600363d7eed5ab7a","permalink":"https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/publication/patel-2018-semi/","publishdate":"2019-06-27T12:40:43.636185Z","relpermalink":"/publication/patel-2018-semi/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Semi-automatic WordNet Linking using Word Embeddings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diptesh Kanojia","Preethi Jyothi","Pushpak Bhattacharyya"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"956d431caad5bf8b1c040719082e4143","permalink":"https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/publication/kanojia-2018-synthesizing/","publishdate":"2019-06-27T12:40:43.635953Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kanojia-2018-synthesizing/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Synthesizing Audio for Hindi Wordnet","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ritesh Panjwani","Diptesh Kanojia","Pushpak Bhattacharyya"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"4a96343e39d82e05e1e94b8c95451501","permalink":"https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/publication/panjwani-2018-pyiwn/","publishdate":"2019-06-27T12:40:43.636412Z","relpermalink":"/publication/panjwani-2018-pyiwn/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"pyiwn: A Python-based API to access Indian Language WordNets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diptesh Kanojia","Nikhil Wani","Pushpak Bhattacharyya"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"1d266404a0de73edef83e42e47f05123","permalink":"https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/publication/kanojia-2017-your/","publishdate":"2019-06-27T12:40:43.636877Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kanojia-2017-your/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Is your Statement Purposeless?
