This task unifies and consolidates the separate WMT shared tasks on Machine Translation Evaluation Metrics and Quality Estimation from previous years. Our primary goal is to encourage the development and assessment of new state-of-the-art translation quality evaluation systems. The shared task this year consisted of three subtasks: (1) segment-level quality score prediction, (2) span-level translation error annotation, and (3) quality-informed segment-level error correction. The evaluation data for the shared task were provided by the General MT shared task and were complemented by \"challenge sets\" from both the organizers and participants. Task 1 results indicate the strong performance of large LLMs at the system level, while reference-based baseline metrics outperform LLMs at the segment level. Task 2 results indicate that accurate error detection and balancing precision and recall are persistent challenges. Task 3 results show that minimal editing is challenging even when informed by quality indicators.

In this study, we investigate segment-level QE methods comparing encoder-based models such as MonoTransQuest, CometKiwi, and xCOMET with various decoder-based methods (Tower+, ALOPE, and other instruction-fine-tuned language models). Our work primarily focused on utilizing eight low-resource language pairs, involving both English on the source side and the target side of the translation. Results indicate that while fine-tuned encoder-based models remain strong performers across most low-resource language pairs, decoder-based Large Language Models (LLMs) show clear improvements when adapted through instruction tuning. Importantly, the ALOPE framework further enhances LLM performance beyond standard fine-tuning, demonstrating its effectiveness in narrowing the gap with encoder-based approaches and highlighting its potential as a viable strategy for low-resource QE. In addition, our experiments demonstrates that with adaptation techniques such as LoRA (Low Rank Adapters) and quantization, decoder-based QE models can be trained with competitive GPU memory efficiency, though they generally require substantially more disk space than encoder-based models. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of encoder-based models for low-resource QE and suggest that advances in cross-lingual modeling will be key to improving LLM-based QE in the future.","tags":["quality estimation","machine translation","low-resource languages","LLMs","evaluation"],"title":"Reference-Less Evaluation of Machine Translation: Navigating Through the Resource-Scarce Scenarios","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Archchana Sindhujan","Shenbin Qian","Chan Chi Chun Matthew","Constantin Orăsan","Diptesh Kanojia"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1759276800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1759276800,"objectID":"71cc6c0db70403b0b6b9ea1629c9bd32","permalink":"https://dipteshkanojia.co.uk/publication/sindhujan-etal-2025-alope/","publishdate":"2025-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sindhujan-etal-2025-alope/","section":"publication","summary":"Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks.

This study investigates whether integrating aggression detection as an auxiliary task within a unified training framework can enhance the generalisation and performance of large language models (LLMs) in cyberbullying detection. Experiments are conducted on five aggression datasets and one cyberbullying dataset using instruction-tuned LLMs. We evaluated multiple strategies: zero-shot, few-shot, independent LoRA fine-tuning, and multi-task learning (MTL). Given the inconsistent results of MTL, we propose an enriched prompt pipeline approach in which aggression predictions are embedded into cyberbullying detection prompts to provide contextual augmentation. Preliminary results show that the enriched prompt pipeline consistently outperforms standard LoRA fine-tuning, indicating that aggression-informed context significantly boosts cyberbullying detection. This study highlights the potential of auxiliary tasks, such as aggression detection, to improve the generalisation of LLMs for safety-critical applications on social networks.","tags":["cyberbullying detection","aggression","LLMs","prompting","social media"],"title":"Cyberbullying Detection via Aggression-Enhanced Prompting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Girish A Koushik","Fatemeh Nazarieh","Katherine Birch","Shenbin Qian","Diptesh Kanojia"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1756080000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1756080000,"objectID":"3eafb750e908fe49ca027e993c45641d","permalink":"https://dipteshkanojia.co.uk/publication/koushik-etal-2025-mind/","publishdate":"2025-08-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/koushik-etal-2025-mind/","section":"publication","summary":"Visual metaphor generation is a challenging task that aims to generate an image given an input text metaphor. Inherently, it needs language understanding to bind a source concept with a target concept, in a way that preserves meaning while ensuring visual coherence. We propose a self-evaluating visual metaphor generation framework that focuses on metaphor alignment. Our self-evaluation approach combines existing metrics with our newly proposed metaphor decomposition score and a meaning alignment (MA) metric. Within this setup, we explore two novel approaches: a training-free pipeline that explicitly decomposes prompts into source-target-meaning (S-T-M) mapping for image synthesis, and a complementary training-based pipeline that improves alignment using our proposed self-evaluation reward schema, without any large-scale retraining. On the held-out test set, the training-free approach surpasses strong closed baselines (GPT-4o, Imagen) on decomposition, CLIP, and MA scores, with the training-based approach close behind. We evaluate our framework output using a user-facing study, and observed that participants preferred GPT-4o overall, while our training-free pipeline led open-source methods and edged Imagen on abstract metaphors. Our analyses show S-T-M prompting helps longer or more abstract metaphors, with closed models excelling on short, concrete cases; we also observe sensitivity to sampler settings. Overall, structured prompting and lightweight RL perform metaphor alignment well under modest compute, and remaining gaps to human preference appear driven by aesthetics and sampling.","tags":["visual metaphor generation","reward framework","image synthesis","metaphor alignment"],"title":"The Mind's Eye: A Multi-Faceted Reward Framework for Guiding Visual Metaphor Generation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dipankar Srirag","Aditya Joshi","Jordan Painter","Diptesh Kanojia"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1753574400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1753574400,"objectID":"161136754e99d62896ac30673bbb3f42","permalink":"https://dipteshkanojia.co.uk/publication/srirag-etal-2025-besstie/","publishdate":"2025-07-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/srirag-etal-2025-besstie/","section":"publication","summary":"Despite large language models (LLMs) being known to exhibit bias against non-mainstream varieties, there are no known labeled datasets for sentiment analysis of English. To address this gap, we introduce BESSTIE, a benchmark for sentiment and sarcasm classification for three varieties of English: Australian (en-AU), Indian (en-IN), and British (en-UK). Using web-based content from two domains, namely, Google Place reviews and Reddit comments, we collect datasets for these language varieties using two methods: location-based and topic-based filtering. Native speakers of the language varieties manually annotate the datasets with sentiment and sarcasm labels. To assess whether the dataset accurately represents these varieties, we conduct two validation steps: (a) manual annotation of language varieties and (b) automatic language variety prediction. We perform an additional annotation exercise to validate the reliance of the annotated labels. Subsequently, we fine-tune nine large language models (LLMs) (representing a range of encoder/decoder and mono/multilingual models) on these datasets, and evaluate their performance on the two tasks. Our results reveal that the models consistently perform better on inner-circle varieties (i.e., en-AU and en-UK), with significant performance drops for en-IN, particularly in sarcasm detection. We also report challenges in cross-variety generalisation, highlighting the need for language variety-specific datasets such as ours. BESSTIE promises to be a useful evaluative benchmark for future research in equitable LLMs, specifically in terms of language varieties.

Recent studies have proposed emotion-related datasets, frameworks and models to automatically evaluate MT quality of Chinese UGC, without relying on reference translations. However, whether these models are robust to the challenge of preserving emotional nuances has been left largely unexplored. To this end, we introduce a novel method inspired by information theory which generates challenging Chinese homophone words related to emotions, by leveraging the concept of *self-information*. Our approach generates homophones that were observed to cause translation errors in emotion preservation, and exposes vulnerabilities in MT models struggling to preserve relevant emotions. We evaluate the efficacy of our method using human evaluation and compare it with an existing one, showing that our method achieves higher correlation with human judgments. The generated Chinese homophones, along with their manual translations, are utilized to generate perturbations and to probe the robustness of existing quality evaluation models, including models trained using multi-task learning, fine-tuned variants of multilingual language models, as well as large language models (LLMs). Our results indicate that LLMs with larger size exhibit higher stability and robustness to such perturbations.

Current AVS methods rely on costly fine-grained annotations of mask-audio pairs, making them impractical for scalability. To address this, we propose the Modality Correspondence Alignment (MoCA) framework, which seamlessly integrates off-the-shelf foundation models like DINO, SAM, and ImageBind. Our approach leverages existing knowledge within these models and optimizes their joint usage for multimodal associations. Our approach relies on estimating positive and negative image pairs in the feature space. For pixel-level association, we introduce an audio-visual adapter and a novel pixel matching aggregation strategy within the image-level contrastive learning framework.

We describe a wide range of NLP tasks in terms of two categories: natural language understanding (NLU) (for tasks such as dialect classification, sentiment analysis, parsing, and NLU benchmarks) and natural language generation (NLG) (for summarisation, machine translation, and dialogue systems). The survey is also broad in its coverage of languages which include English, Arabic, German, among others. We observe that past work in NLP concerning dialects goes deeper than mere dialect classification, and extends to several NLU and NLG tasks. For these tasks, we describe classical machine learning using statistical models, along with the recent deep learning-based approaches based on pre-trained language models.

Despite significant progress in the area, most existing methods concentrate on audio-lip synchronization, often overlooking aspects such as visual quality, customization, and generalization that are crucial to producing realistic talking faces. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel, customizable one-shot audio-driven talking face generation framework, named PortraitTalk. Our proposed method utilizes a latent diffusion framework consisting of two main components: IdentityNet and AnimateNet. IdentityNet is designed to preserve identity features consistently across the generated video frames, while AnimateNet aims to enhance temporal coherence and motion consistency. This framework also integrates an audio input with the reference images, thereby reducing the reliance on reference-style videos prevalent in existing approaches. A key innovation of PortraitTalk is the incorporation of text prompts through decoupled cross-attention mechanisms, which significantly expands creative control over the generated videos. Through extensive experiments, including a newly developed evaluation metric, our model demonstrates superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods, setting a new standard for the generation of customizable realistic talking faces suitable for real-world applications.","tags":["audio-to-talking face generation","diffusion models","customization","one-shot"],"title":"PortraitTalk: Towards Customizable One-Shot Audio-to-Talking Face Generation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Swapnil Bhosale","Haosen Yang","Diptesh Kanojia","Jiankang Deng","Xiatian Zhu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1733788800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1733788800,"objectID":"3cb6aa0e8336738e563ecaebb888a0b9","permalink":"https://dipteshkanojia.co.uk/publication/bhosale-etal-2024-av/","publishdate":"2024-12-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bhosale-etal-2024-av/","section":"publication","summary":"Novel view acoustic synthesis (NVAS) aims to render binaural audio at any target viewpoint, given a mono audio emitted by a sound source at a 3D scene. Existing methods have proposed NeRF-based implicit models to exploit visual cues as a condition for synthesizing binaural audio. However, in addition to low efficiency originating from heavy NeRF rendering, these methods all have a limited ability of characterizing the entire scene environment such as room geometry, material properties, and the spatial relation between the listener and sound source. To address these issues, we propose a novel Audio-Visual Gaussian Splatting (AV-GS) model. To obtain a material-aware and geometry-aware condition for audio synthesis, we learn an explicit point-based scene representation with an audio-guidance parameter on locally initialized Gaussian points, taking into account the space relation from the listener and sound source. To make the visual scene model audio adaptive, we propose a point densification and pruning strategy to optimally distribute the Gaussian points, with the per-point contribution in sound propagation (e.g., more points needed for texture-less wall surfaces as they affect sound path diversion). Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our AV-GS over existing alternatives on the real-world RWAS and simulation-based SoundSpaces datasets.","tags":["acoustic synthesis","gaussian splatting","novel view synthesis","audio-visual"],"title":"AV-GS: Learning Material and Geometry aware Priors for Novel View Acoustic Synthesis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fatemeh Nazarieh","Josef Kittler","Muhammad Awais Rana","Diptesh Kanojia","Zhenhua Feng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1733184000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1733184000,"objectID":"4bb8705fca306f0e157f8561134ecd04","permalink":"https://dipteshkanojia.co.uk/publication/nazarieh-etal-2025-stabletalk/","publishdate":"2024-12-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nazarieh-etal-2025-stabletalk/","section":"publication","summary":"Audio-to-talking face generation stands at the forefront of advancements in generative AI.

To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach, StableTalk, leveraging the emerging capabilities of Stable diffusion models and vision Transformers for Talking face generation.

Sarcasm is widely used on social media and other forms of computer-mediated communication motivating the use of computational models to identify it automatically. While the clear majority of approaches to sarcasm detection have been carried out on text only, sarcasm detection often requires additional information present in tonality, facial expression, and contextual images. This has led to the introduction of multimodal models, opening the possibility to detect sarcasm in multiple modalities such as audio, images, text, and video. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive survey on multimodal sarcasm detection - henceforth MSD - to date. We survey papers published between 2018 and 2023 on the topic, and discuss the models and datasets used for this task. We also present future research directions in MSD.","tags":["sarcasm detection","multimodal","survey"],"title":"A Survey of Multimodal Sarcasm Detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Archchana Sindhujan","Diptesh Kanojia","Constantin Orăsan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1719964800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1719964800,"objectID":"204e43f87489a17f4d28aa08b9a15624","permalink":"https://dipteshkanojia.co.uk/publication/sindhujan-etal-2024-optimizing/","publishdate":"2024-07-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sindhujan-etal-2024-optimizing/","section":"publication","summary":"Quality Estimation (QE) is vital to determine the effectiveness of MT systems.

While most common among teenagers, it also affects other demographics. Despite strict zero-tolerance policies on social media, the elusive nature of cyberbullying persists. Simple word searches are insufficient, leading to the exploration of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to detect and classify cyberbullying. This study balances result accuracy with model simplicity, crucial for an effective detector. Quick identification of offensive content is essential to combat cyberbullying. The ever-changing slang and trends require an easily updatable detector. Using a cyberbullying dataset from real tweets on X (formerly Twitter), this study initially applies traditional machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, and Random Forests. The investigation then moves to Transformers-based autoencoders from the BERT family, including sentence-transformers. However, these models require significant memory and disk space due to their large number of training parameters. The study focuses on the efficiency of cyberbullying detectors using character-level language models based on the bidirectional long-short-term memory (BiLSTM) neural architecture. Our experiments demonstrate that these detectors offer comparable performance and provide a practical option for real-world deployment.","tags":["cyberbullying","social media","machine learning"],"title":"Decoding Cyberbullying on Social Media: A Machine Learning Exploration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leonardo Zilio","Shenbin Qian","Diptesh Kanojia","Constantin Orăsan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1716163200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1716163200,"objectID":"a202d2a102d087b16815309d2df2e179","permalink":"https://dipteshkanojia.co.uk/publication/zilio-etal-2024-using/","publishdate":"2024-05-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zilio-etal-2024-using/","section":"publication","summary":"Abbreviations and their associated long forms are important textual elements that are present in almost every scientific communication, and having information about these forms can help improve several NLP tasks.

After re-training selected models on the revised dataset, results show that character-level models achieve comparable results, especially when detecting abbreviations, but both RoBERTa large and the stacking of embeddings presented better results on biomedical data.

In this work, we reformulate the SED problem by taking a generative learning perspective. Specifically, we aim to generate sound temporal boundaries from noisy proposals in a denoising diffusion process, conditioned on a target audio sample. During training, our model learns to reverse the noising process by converting noisy latent queries to the ground-truth versions in the elegant Transformer decoder framework. Doing so enables the model generate accurate event boundaries from even noisy queries during inference. Extensive experiments on the Urban-SED and EPIC-Sounds datasets demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms existing alternatives, with 40+% faster convergence in training.

The MonoTQ-InfoXLM-large approach emerges as a robust strategy, surpassing all other individual models proposed in this study by significantly improving over the baseline for the majority of the language pairs.","tags":["quality estimation","machine translation","shared task","transquest"],"title":"SurreyAI 2023 Submission for the Quality Estimation Shared Task","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Swapnil Bhosale","Abhra Chaudhuri","Alex Lee Robert Williams","Divyank Tiwari","Anjan Dutta","Xiatian Zhu","Pushpak Bhattacharyya","Diptesh Kanojia"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1696291200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1696291200,"objectID":"624e02b98d9358138e2235c765c920e2","permalink":"https://dipteshkanojia.co.uk/publication/bhosale-etal-2023-sarcasm/","publishdate":"2023-10-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bhosale-etal-2023-sarcasm/","section":"publication","summary":"The introduction of the MUStARD dataset, and its emotion recognition extension MUStARD++, have identified sarcasm to be a multi-modal phenomenon -- expressed not only in natural language text, but also through manners of speech (like tonality and intonation) and visual cues (facial expression).

We invited ten Chinese-English translators to translate thirty posts of a Chinese microblog, and interviewed them about the challenges encountered during translation and the problems they believe MT might have. Further, we analysed more than five-thousand automatic translations of microblog posts to observe problems in MT outputs. We establish that the most challenging problem for human translators is emotion-carrying words, which translators also consider as a problem for MT. Analysis of MT outputs shows that this is also the most common source of MT errors. We also find that what is challenging for MT, such as non-standard writing, is not necessarily an issue for humans. Our work contributes to a better understanding of the challenges for the translation of microblog posts by humans and MT, caused by different forms of expression of emotion.","tags":["machine translation","emotion translation","human translation","chinese microblog"],"title":"Challenges of Human vs Machine Translation of Emotion-Loaded Chinese Microblog Texts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Swapnil Bhosale","Haosen Yang","Diptesh Kanojia","Xiatian Zhu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1694476800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1694476800,"objectID":"9b86bc6ee9659907a543ab5a2b122b92","permalink":"https://dipteshkanojia.co.uk/publication/bhosale-etal-2023-leveraging/","publishdate":"2023-09-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bhosale-etal-2023-leveraging/","section":"publication","summary":"Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to precisely outline audible objects in a visual scene at the pixel level. Existing AVS methods require fine-grained annotations of audio-mask pairs in supervised learning fashion. This limits their scalability since it is time consuming and tedious to acquire such cross-modality pixel level labels. To overcome this obstacle, in this work we introduce unsupervised audio-visual segmentation with no need for task-specific data annotations and model training. For tackling this newly proposed problem, we formulate a novel Cross-Modality Semantic Filtering (CMSF) approach to accurately associate the underlying audio-mask pairs by leveraging the off-the-shelf multi-modal foundation models (e.g., detection [1], open-world segmentation [2] and multi-modal alignment [3]). Guiding the proposal generation by either audio or visual cues, we design two training-free variants: AT-GDINO-SAM and OWOD-BIND. Extensive experiments on the AVS-Bench dataset show that our unsupervised approach can perform well in comparison to prior art supervised counterparts across complex scenarios with multiple auditory objects. Particularly, in situations where existing supervised AVS methods struggle with overlapping foreground objects, our models still excel in accurately segmenting overlapped auditory objects. Our code will be publicly released.","tags":["audio-visual segmentation","foundation models","unsupervised learning"],"title":"Leveraging Foundation Models for Unsupervised Audio-Visual Segmentation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Akash Rawat","Nazia Nafis","Dnyaneshwar Bhadane","Diptesh Kanojia","Rudra Murthy"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1689206400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1689206400,"objectID":"33e253ac288f04499c74f7bced6abee2","permalink":"https://dipteshkanojia.co.uk/publication/rawat-2023-modelling-political-aggression/","publishdate":"2023-07-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rawat-2023-modelling-political-aggression/","section":"publication","summary":"Recent years have seen a proliferation of aggressive social media posts, often wreaking even real-world consequences for victims.

We manually annotate this data for the task of aggression detection and analyze this data for aggressive behaviour. To benchmark the efficacy of our dataset, we perform experiments by fine-tuning pre-trained language models and comparing the results with models trained on an existing but general domain dataset. Our models consistently outperform the models trained on existing data. Our best model achieves a macro F1-score of 66.66 on our dataset. We also train models on a combined version of both datasets, achieving best macro F1-score of 92.77, on our dataset.

Conventional approaches to QE involve training separate models at different levels of granularity viz., word-level, sentence-level, and document-level, which sometimes lead to inconsistent predictions for the same input. To overcome this limitation, we focus on jointly training a single model for sentence-level and word-level QE tasks in a multi-task learning framework. Using two multi-task learning-based QE approaches, we show that multi-task learning improves the performance of both tasks. We evaluate these approaches by performing experiments in different settings, viz., single-pair, multi-pair, and zero-shot. We compare the multi-task learning-based approach with baseline QE models trained on single tasks and observe an improvement of up to 4.28% in Pearson's correlation (r) at sentence-level and 8.46% in F1-score at word-level, in the single-pair setting. In the multi-pair setting, we observe improvements of up to 3.04% at sentence-level and 13.74% at word-level; while in the zero-shot setting, we also observe improvements of up to 5.26% and 3.05%, respectively.

Sarcasm detection remains a largely unsolved problem in many NLP tasks due to its contradictory and typically derogatory nature as a figurative language construct. With recent strides in NLP, many pre-trained language models exist that have been trained on data from specific social media platforms, i.e., Twitter. In this paper, we evaluate the efficacy of multiple sarcasm detection datasets using machine and deep learning models. We create two new datasets - a manually annotated gold standard Sarcasm Annotated Dataset (SAD) and a Silver-Standard Sarcasm-annotated Dataset (S3D). Using a combination of existing sarcasm datasets with SAD, we train a sarcasm detection model over a social-media domain pre-trained language model, BERTweet, which yields an F1-score of 78.29%. Using an Ensemble model with an underlying majority technique, we further label S3D to produce a weakly supervised dataset containing over 100,000 tweets.

However, they are known to produce fluent translation outputs that can contain important meaning errors, thus undermining their reliability in practice. Quality Estimation (QE) is the task of automatically assessing the performance of MT systems at test time. Thus, in order to be useful, QE systems should be able to detect such errors. However, this ability is yet to be tested in the current evaluation practices, where QE systems are assessed only in terms of their correlation with human judgements. In this talk, we will discuss how we attempted to bridge this gap by proposing a general methodology for the adversarial testing of QE for MT. In this discussion, we first see that despite a high correlation with human judgements achieved by the recent SOTA, certain types of meaning errors are still problematic for QE to detect. We also discuss how the ability of a given model to discriminate between meaning-preserving and meaning-altering perturbations is predictive of its overall performance, thus potentially allowing us to compare the QE systems without relying on manual quality annotation.","tags":["talks","quality estimation","machine translation","adversarial evaluation","probing systems"],"title":"Quality Estimation","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Diptesh Kanojia"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1663331400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663331400,"objectID":"1d7f82ddd3fbb83e9e169985512076a9","permalink":"https://dipteshkanojia.co.uk/talk/lithmetalk/","publishdate":"2022-09-16T13:30:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/lithmetalk/","section":"talk","summary":"In this invited talk to the [LITHME WG8](https://lithme.eu/working-groups/wg8/) meeting, I gave an introduction to chatbots and its basic building blocks.

Fact-checking organizations try to debunk as many claims as possible while staying true to their journalistic processes but cannot cope with its rapid dissemination. We believe that the solution lies in partial automation of the fact-checking life cycle, saving human time for tasks which require high cognition. We propose a new workflow for efficiently detecting previously fact-checked claims that uses abstractive summarization to generate crisp queries. These queries can then be executed on a general-purpose retrieval system associated with a collection of previously fact-checked claims. We curate an abstractive text summarization dataset comprising noisy claims from Twitter and their gold summaries. It is shown that retrieval performance improves 2x by using popular out-of-the-box summarization models and 3x by fine-tuning them on the accompanying dataset compared to verbatim querying.

Named Entities can also be multi-word expressions where the additional I-O-B annotation information helps label them during the NER annotation process. While English and European languages have considerable annotated data for the NER task, Indian languages lack on that front- both in terms of quantity and following annotation standards. This paper releases a significantly sized standard-abiding Hindi NER dataset containing 109,146 sentences and 2,220,856 tokens, annotated with 11 tags. We discuss the dataset statistics in all their essential detail and provide an in-depth analysis of the NER tag-set used with our data. The statistics of tag-set in our dataset show a healthy per-tag distribution, especially for prominent classes like Person, Location and Organisation. Since the proof of resource-effectiveness is in building models with the resource and testing the model on benchmark data and against the leader-board entries in shared tasks, we do the same with the aforesaid data. We use different language models to perform the sequence labelling task for NER and show the efficacy of our data by performing a comparative evaluation with models trained on another dataset available for the Hindi NER task. Our dataset helps achieve a weighted F1 score of 88.78 with all the tags and 92.22 when we collapse the tag-set, as discussed in the paper. To the best of our knowledge, no available dataset meets the standards of volume (amount) and variability (diversity), as far as Hindi NER is concerned. We fill this gap through this work, which we hope will significantly help NLP for Hindi.

We think so, and that is why we prepared this webinar as the first step in helping translators make informed decisions when working with this technology. The volume and quality of machine translation produced today baffles anyone who has been working or wants to start working with translation. Neural machine translation (NMT) is a set of the most advanced machine learning technologies that has been yielding surprising volumes of high-quality machine translation output. NMT uses neural network-based models to learn probabilistic models of languages, in such a way that they can be used to estimate very likely good translations of new source sentences. One of the key benefits of these approaches is to simplify the process of training MT systems. Unlike previous statistical translation systems, which consisted of many small sub-components that were tuned separately, NMT attempts to build and train a single, large neural network which will then be able to read a source sentence and output a translation for it. In this webinar, we will explain the use of widely available programming libraries to create a customised translation engine or model using NMT. The webinar will consist of a step-by-step demonstration of the different stages of training a NMT model, with simple explanations of the terms that are used by researchers that train these systems. The webinar will include introductory answers to questions like: What is a neural network? What are word embeddings? What does training and learning mean? How many stages are there in an NMT training process? What methods are there to improve the quality of the MT output? Why is the translation stage called decoding? There will be time for the participants to ask questions, but they are not expected to perform any hands-on work. As a follow-up to the webinar, we are preparing a short course with hands-on exercises for participants to train their own initial models.

Creating datasets for automatic measurement of humour quotient is difficult due to multiple possible interpretations of the content. In this work, we create a multi-modal humour-annotated dataset (~40 hours) using stand-up comedy clips. We devise a novel scoring mechanism to annotate the training data with a humour quotient score using the audience's laughter. The normalized duration (laughter duration divided by the clip duration) of laughter in each clip is used to compute this humour coefficient score on a five-point scale (0-4). This method of scoring is validated by comparing with manually annotated scores, wherein a quadratic weighted kappa of 0.6 is obtained. We use this dataset to train a model that provides a 'funniness' score, on a five-point scale, given the audio and its corresponding text. We compare various neural language models for the task of humour-rating and achieve an accuracy of 0.813 in terms of Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK).

This problem is called Noun Compound Interpretation (NCI). We use FrameNet as a semantic label repository. For example, given the noun compound (board approval), we predict the frame (DENY OR GRANT PERMISSION, as per FrameNet) as appropriate and the semantic role of the modifier word (AUTHORITY) as the semantic label linking board and approval; the resulting label is DENY OR GRANT PERMISSION:AUTHORITY. Our semantic label repository is very large (≈11k labels) compared to the NC data available for training (approx 1900). Thus, learning in this case, especially for unseen semantic labels, is hard. We propose to solve this problem by predicting semantic labels in a continuous label embedding space, which is novel. This embedding space is created by learning label embeddings using the FrameNet data. The embeddings are then used to train two separate models – one for predicting Frames and the other for FEs. As the label embedding space captures the semantics of the labels, using these embeddings enables generalizing well on unseen labels, thus achieving zero-shot learning. Our preliminary investigations show that the proposed approach performs well for unseen labels, achieving 5% and 2% points improvements over baselines for the frame and FE prediction, respectively. The study shows the promise of the use of continuous space embeddings for noun compound interpretation and points to the need for further investigation.","tags":["noun-compound","deep learning","framenet","theoretical"],"title":"FrameNet-assisted Noun Compound Interpretation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diptesh Kanojia","Prashant Sharma","Sayali Ghodekar","Pushpak Bhattacharyya","Gholamreza Haffari","Malhar Kulkarni"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1619136000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619136000,"objectID":"9975875309a41d4a552b44995a750bfe","permalink":"https://dipteshkanojia.co.uk/publication/eacl-2021-cognate/","publishdate":"2021-04-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/eacl-2021-cognate/","section":"publication","summary":"Automatic detection of cognates helps downstream NLP tasks of Machine Translation, Cross-lingual Information Retrieval, Computational Phylogenetics and Cross-lingual Named Entity Recognition.

We place these embeddings for all these languages, viz., Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Konkani, Malayalam, Marathi, Nepali, Odiya, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Tamil, and Telugu in a single repository. Relatively newer approaches that emphasize catering to context (BERT, ELMo, etc.) have shown significant improvements, but require a large amount of resources to generate usable models. We release pre-trained embeddings generated using both contextual and non-contextual approaches. We also use MUSE and XLM to train cross-lingual embeddings for all pairs of the aforementioned languages. To show the efficacy of our embeddings, we evaluate our embedding models on XPOS, UPOS and NER tasks for all these languages. We release a total of 436 models using 8 different approaches.

These theories can be used to build computational tools for word sense disambiguation (WSD). In the absence of WSD, one cannot have proper verbal cognition. These theories considered the concept of ‘Yogyatā’ (congruity or compatibility) as the indispensable cause of verbal cognition. In this work, we come up with some insights on the basis of these theories to create a tool that will capture Yogyatā of words. We describe the problem of ambiguity in a text and present a method to resolve it computationally with the help of Yogyatā. Here, only two major schools i.e. Nyāya and Vyākaraṇa are considered.

To do this, we first we model text quality as a function of three properties - organization, coherence and cohesion. Then, we demonstrate how capturing gaze behaviour helps in predicting each of these properties, and hence the overall quality, by reporting improvements obtained by adding gaze features to traditional textual features for score prediction. We also hypothesize that if a reader has fully understood the text, the corresponding gaze behaviour would give a better indication of the assigned rating, as opposed to partial understanding.

The collection of the definitions of a sentence can be found in the text ‘Vākyapadīya’ written by Bhartṛhari in fifth century C.E. The grammarian-philosopher Bhartṛhari and his authoritative work ‘Vākyapadīya’ have been a matter of study for modern scholars, at least for more than 50 years, since Ashok Aklujkar submitted his Ph.D. dissertation at Harvard University. The notions of a sentence and a word as a meaningful linguistic unit in the language have been a subject matter for the discussion in many works that followed later on. While some scholars have applied philological techniques to critically establish the text of the works of Bhartṛhari, some others have devoted themselves to exploring philosophical insights from them. Some others have studied his works from the point of view of modern linguistics, and psychology. Few others have tried to justify the views by logical discussions. In this paper, we present a fresh view to study Bhartṛhari, and his works, especially the ‘Vākyapadīya’. This view is from the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), more specifically, what is called as Cognitive NLP. We have studied the definitions of a sentence given by Bhartṛhari at the beginning of the second chapter of ‘Vākyapadīya’. We have researched one of these definitions by conducting an experiment and following the methodology of silent-reading of Sanskrit paragraphs. We collect the Gaze-behavior data of participants and analyze it to understand the underlying comprehension procedure in the human mind and present our results. We evaluate the statistical significance of our results using T-test, and discuss the caveats of our work.

Linked wordnets are extensions of wordnets, which link similar concepts in wordnets of different languages. Such resources are extremely useful in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, primarily those based on knowledge-based approaches. In such approaches, these resources are considered as gold standard/oracle. Thus, it is crucial that these resources hold correct information. Thereby, they are created by human experts. However, manual maintenance of such resources is a tedious and costly affair. Thus techniques that can aid the experts are desirable. In this paper, we propose an approach to link wordnets. Given a synset of the source language, the approach returns a ranked list of potential candidate synsets in the target language from which the human expert can choose the correct one(s). Our technique is able to retrieve a winner synset in the top 10 ranked list for 60% of all synsets and 70% of noun synsets.","tags":["mapping","wordnets","linguistics"],"title":"Semi-automatic WordNet Linking using Word Embeddings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diptesh Kanojia","Preethi Jyothi","Pushpak Bhattacharyya"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"956d431caad5bf8b1c040719082e4143","permalink":"https://dipteshkanojia.co.uk/publication/kanojia-2018-synthesizing/","publishdate":"2019-06-27T12:40:43.635953Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kanojia-2018-synthesizing/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we describe our work on the creation of a voice model using a speech synthesis system for the Hindi Language.

The system uses the OpenclipArt library (OCAL) to retrieve images and ranks them. (2) After retrieving the images, we map the results along with the linkages between Princeton WordNet and Hindi WordNet, to link several synsets to corresponding images. We choose and sort top three images based on our ranking heuristic per synset. (3) We develop a tool that allows a lexicographer to manually evaluate these images. The top images are shown to a lexicographer by the evaluation tool for the task of choosing the best image representation. The lexicographer also selects the number of relevant images.

To maximize linkages, an important strategy of using direct and hypernymy linkages has been followed. However, the hypernymy linkages were found to be inadequate in certain cases and posed a challenge due to sense granularity of language. Thus, the idea of creating bilingual mappings was adopted as a solution. A bilingual mapping means a linkage between a concept in two different languages, with the help of translation and/or transliteration. Such mappings retain meaningful representations, while capturing semantic similarity at the same time.

In absence of such dictionaries, a coarse dictionary may be required. This paper demonstrates the use of a multilingual topic model for creating coarse dictionaries for English-Hindi MT. We compare our approaches with: (a) a baseline with no additional dictionary injection, and (b) a corpus with a good quality dictionary. Our results show that the existing Cartesian product approach which is used to create the pseudo-parallel data results in a degradation on tourism and health datasets, for English-Hindi MT. Our paper points to the fact that existing Cartesian approach using multilingual topics (devised for European languages) may be detrimental for Indian language MT. On the other hand, we present an alternate ‘sentential’ approach that leads to a slight improvement. However, our sentential approach (using a parallel corpus injected with a coarse dictionary) outperforms a system trained using parallel corpus and a good quality dictionary.","tags":["topic models","machine translation","application"],"title":"Using Multilingual Topic Models for Improved Alignment in English-Hindi MT","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hanumant Harichandra Redkar","Sudha Baban Bhingardive","Diptesh Kanojia","Pushpak Bhattacharyya"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"bd887cc7ad0ca678dfd99c5c00ddf912","permalink":"https://dipteshkanojia.co.uk/publication/redkar-2015-world/","publishdate":"2019-06-27T12:40:43.632029Z","relpermalink":"/publication/redkar-2015-world/","section":"publication","summary":"WordNet is an online lexical resource which expresses unique concepts in a language. English WordNet is the first WordNet which was developed at Princeton University. Over a period of time, many language WordNets were developed by various organizations all over the world.

In this paper, we present the World WordNet Database Structure which can be used to efficiently store the WordNet information of all languages of the World. This design can be adapted by most language WordNets to store information such as synset data, semantic and lexical relations, ontology details, language specific features, linguistic information, etc. An attempt is made to develop Application Programming Interfaces to manipulate the data from these databases.

However, these approaches can be classified as weak AI systems. According to the classical definition, a strong AI based WSD system should perform the task of sense disambiguation in the same manner and with similar accuracy as human beings. In order to accomplish this, a detailed understanding of the human techniques employed for sense disambiguation is necessary. Instead of building yet another WSD system that uses contextual evidence for sense disambiguation, as has been done before, we have taken a step back - we have endeavored to discover the cognitive faculties that lie at the very core of the human sense disambiguation technique. In this paper, we present a hypothesis regarding the cognitive sub-processes involved in the task of WSD. We support our hypothesis using the experiments conducted through the means of an eye-tracking device. We also strive to find the levels of difficulties in annotating various classes of words, with senses. We believe, once such an in-depth analysis is performed, numerous insights can be gained to develop a robust WSD system that conforms to the principle of strong AI.","tags":["gaze tracking","word sense disambiguation","theoretical"],"title":"More than meets the eye: Study of Human Cognition in Sense Annotation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Arindam Chatterjee","Salil Joshi","Pushpak Bhattacharyya","Diptesh Kanojia","Akhlesh Kumar Meena"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"cb5f13494aed36490a8f152e07b74d5d","permalink":"https://dipteshkanojia.co.uk/publication/chatterjee-2012-study/","publishdate":"2019-06-27T12:40:43.631013Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chatterjee-2012-study/","section":"publication","summary":"Does context help determine sense? This question might seem frivolous, even preposterous to anybody sensible. However, our long time research on Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) shows that in almost all disambiguation algorithms, the sense distribution parameter P(S/W), where P is the probability of the sense of a word W being S, plays the deciding role. The widely reported accuracy figure of around 60% for all-words-domain-independent WSD is contributed to mainly by P(S/W), as one ablation test after another reveals. The story with human annotation is different though. Our experience of working with human annotators who mark with WordNet sense ids, general and domain specific corpora brings to light the interesting fact that producing sense ids without looking at the context is a heavy cognitive load. Sense annotators do form hypothesis in their minds about the possible sense of a word (‘most frequent sense’ bias), but then look at the context for clues to accept or reject the hypothesis. Such clues are minimal, just one or two words, but are critical nonetheless. Without these clues the annotator is left in an indecisive state as to whether or not to put down the first sense coming to his mind. The task becomes all the more cognitively challenging, if the senses are fine grained and seem equally probable. These facts increase the annotation time by a factor of almost 1.5. In the current paper we explore the dichotomy that might exist between machines and humans in the way they determine senses. We study the various parameters for WSD and also the sense marking behavior of human sense annotators. The observations, though not completely conclusive, establish the need for context for humans and that for accurate sense distribution parameters for machines.","tags":["word sense disambiguation","theoretical"],"title":"A Study of the Sense Annotation Process: Man v/s Machine.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diptesh Kanojia","Arindam Chatterjee","Salil Joshi","Pushpak Bhattacharyya"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"90073a90cba2d3992fee7ae2988160f3","permalink":"https://dipteshkanojia.co.uk/publication/kanojia-2012-discrimination/","publishdate":"2019-06-27T12:40:43.632706Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kanojia-2012-discrimination/","section":"publication","summary":"Current state-of-the-art Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) algorithms are mostly supervised and use the P (Sense|Word) statistic for annotation. This P (Sense|Word) statistic is obtained after training the model on an annotated corpus. The performance of WSD algorithms do not match the efficiency and quality of human annotation. It is therefore important to know the role of the contextual clues in WSD. Human beings in turn, actuate the task of disambiguating the sense of a word, by gathering hints from the context words in the neighbourhood of the word. Contextual clues thus form the basic building block for the human sense disambiguation task. The need was thus felt for a tool, which could help us get a deeper insight into the human mind, while disambiguating polysemous words. As mentioned earlier, in the human mind, sense disambiguation highly depends on finding clues in corpus text, which finally lead to a winner sense. In order to make WSD algorithms more efficient, it is highly desirable to assimilate knowledge regarding contextual clues of words. In order to make WSD algorithms more efficient, it is highly desirable to assimilate knowledge regarding contextual clues of words, which aid in finding correct senses of words in that context. Hence, we developed a tool which could help a lexicographer mark the clues for disambiguating a word in a context. In the current phase, this tool lets the lexicographer select the clues from the gloss and example fields in the synset, and adds them to a database.","tags":["word sense disambiguation","applciation","linguistics"],"title":"Discrimination-net for Hindi","type":"publication"}]
